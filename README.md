# MX108 Arduino Library

## Overview
The MX108 Arduino Library provides an easy interface to control one or two DC motors using an MX108-compatible H-bridge motor driver.  
It supports bidirectional control, PWM speed, and simple braking.

### Features
- Forward, reverse, stop, and brake modes
- PWM-based speed control (0–100%)
- Supports single or dual motor setups
- Works on any Arduino-compatible board
- Includes example sketches for quick start
